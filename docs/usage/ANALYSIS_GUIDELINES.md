# Guidelines for Analyzing NLP Pipeline Results

This document provides guidance for human analysts working with the Sentinel NLP pipeline outputs to make informed decisions about potential threats to democracy.

## Interpreting Threat Scores

The pipeline assigns overall threat scores on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0:

| Score Range | Risk Level | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 0.0 - 0.2   | Minimal    | Content likely poses no significant threat to democratic institutions |
| 0.2 - 0.4   | Low        | Content contains some concerning elements but limited practical impact |
| 0.4 - 0.6   | Moderate   | Content may pose meaningful threats in certain contexts |
| 0.6 - 0.8   | High       | Content presents significant risks to democratic systems |
| 0.8 - 1.0   | Severe     | Content represents urgent and substantial democratic threats |

Remember that these scores are algorithmic estimates, not definitive assessments. Always apply human judgment.

## Threat Categories and Their Meaning

The pipeline categorizes threats into several key areas:

| Category | Description | Key Indicators |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `election_integrity` | Threats to fair and open elections | Voter restrictions, registration barriers, polling limitations |
| `civil_liberties` | Restrictions on fundamental freedoms | Free speech limitations, assembly restrictions, privacy intrusions |
| `separation_of_powers` | Erosion of checks and balances | Court packing, legislative overrides, executive overreach |
| `media_freedom` | Constraints on press independence | Censorship, journalist intimidation, information control |
| `judicial_independence` | Undermining court impartiality | Judge removal, jurisdiction stripping, political appointments |
| `rule_of_law` | Weakening legal frameworks | Selective enforcement, retroactive laws, immunity provisions |
| `executive_power` | Inappropriate executive authority | Emergency powers, decree authority, oversight avoidance |
| `minority_rights` | Disadvantaging minority groups | Discriminatory policies, unequal protections, targeted restrictions |

## Contextual Analysis Framework

When evaluating documents, consider these dimensions:

1. **Constitutional Compatibility**
   - Does the content contradict constitutional principles?
   - Are there clear violations or just potential tensions?

2. **Historical Precedent**
   - Has similar content led to democratic erosion in other contexts?
   - Are there historical patterns that provide insight?

3. **Implementation Feasibility**
   - How likely is the proposed change to be implemented?
   - What institutional barriers exist to prevent harmful impacts?

4. **Scope and Scale**
   - How many citizens would be affected?
   - How fundamental are the democratic principles at stake?

5. **Reversibility**
   - How difficult would it be to reverse these changes once implemented?
   - Are there permanent structural alterations to democratic systems?

## Decision-Making Workflow

Follow this process when analyzing pipeline results:

1. **Initial Screening**
   - Review overall threat score and top categories
   - Identify documents scoring above 0.6 for priority analysis

2. **Content Verification**
   - Read the original document carefully
   - Verify the accuracy of entity extraction and pattern detection

3. **Contextual Assessment**
   - Apply the contextual framework above
   - Consider the source, authority, and implementation pathway

4. **Expert Consultation**
   - For high-threat documents (>0.7), consult with subject matter experts
   - Seek input from legal, political science, or regional specialists

5. **Response Recommendation**
   - Develop a clear position on the democratic threat level
   - Document your reasoning and supporting evidence
   - Propose appropriate monitoring, advocacy, or intervention actions

## Common Analysis Pitfalls

Avoid these common errors when interpreting results:

1. **Over-reliance on scores**: Don't treat numerical scores as definitive judgments
2. **Decontextualization**: Consider the political and social context of each document
3. **False equivalence**: Not all threats to democracy are equal in severity or likelihood
4. **Partisan bias**: Evaluate threats objectively regardless of political alignment
5. **Alarmism**: Distinguish between genuine threats and routine political disagreements
6. **Tunnel vision**: Consider how different threat categories interact with each other

## Case Examples

### Example 1: High-Threat Legislature Bill (Score: 0.76)

```json
{
  "title": "Electoral District Reorganization Act",
  "threat_score": 0.76,
  "threat_categories": {
    "election_integrity": 0.89,
    "minority_rights": 0.72,
    "rule_of_law": 0.68
  }
}
```

**Analysis:**
- High overall threat score warrants immediate attention
- Primary concern in election integrity category
- Verify if redistricting creates unfair advantage
- Assess impact on minority voting power
- Consider historical patterns of similar legislation
- Evaluate court precedents on redistricting

### Example 2: Moderate-Threat Executive Order (Score: 0.54)

```json
{
  "title": "Executive Order on Media Credentialing",
  "threat_score": 0.54,
  "threat_categories": {
    "media_freedom": 0.67,
    "civil_liberties": 0.45,
    "executive_power": 0.51
  }
}
```

**Analysis:**
- Moderate threat requiring careful assessment
- Primary concern in media freedom category
- Review specific credentialing requirements
- Evaluate neutrality of standards
- Consider implementation authority and oversight
- Assess appeal mechanisms for denied credentials

## Reporting Guidelines

When documenting your analysis:

1. **Be specific**: Cite exact text passages that raise concerns
2. **Be objective**: Present evidence before conclusions
3. **Be comprehensive**: Address all relevant threat categories
4. **Be proportional**: Match your concern level to the actual threat
5. **Be constructive**: Suggest specific monitoring or response actions

## Final Notes

The Sentinel NLP pipeline is a tool to assist human analysis, not replace it. Its purpose is to flag potential concerns and provide an initial assessment structure. The ultimate evaluation of democratic threats requires human judgment, contextual understanding, and specialized expertise.
