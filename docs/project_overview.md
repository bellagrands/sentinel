# Sentinel Project Overview

## Introduction
Sentinel is an advanced democracy watchdog system designed to monitor and analyze public government data, legal filings, and legislative activities. Its primary purpose is to provide early warnings of potential anti-democratic actions by scanning and analyzing various government sources, including proposed laws, lawsuits, agency changes, and other official notices.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - Multiple specialized scrapers for different data sources:
     - Federal Register scraper (`federal_register.py`)
     - Congress.gov integration (`congress_api.py`, `congress_gov.py`)
     - PACER court system scraper (`pacer_scraper.py`)
     - State legislature monitor (`state_legislature.py`)
     - Local government tracker (`local_gov.py`)

2. **Processing Layer** (`processor/`)
   - Document analysis and threat detection
   - Natural Language Processing (NLP) for content analysis
   - Pattern matching and keyword detection
   - Threat categorization and scoring

3. **Alert System** (`alerts/`)
   - Alert generation based on threat analysis
   - Notification system integration (email, Slack)
   - Alert management and tracking

4. **Interface Layer** (`interface/`)
   - User interface for system interaction
   - Alert review and management
   - Configuration and system management

### Key Features

- **Multi-source Monitoring**: Comprehensive coverage across federal, state, and local government sources
- **Intelligent Analysis**: NLP-based document analysis for threat detection
- **Flexible Alert System**: Customizable notification system for different threat levels
- **Scalable Architecture**: Docker-based deployment for easy scaling
- **API Integration**: Direct integration with government APIs where available

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- Python 3.7+
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries
- Docker containerization
- RESTful APIs

### External Integrations
- Congress.gov API
- Federal Register API
- PACER API (planned)
- Email/Slack notifications

## Configuration and Deployment

### Configuration
- Main configuration file: `config.yaml`
- Environment variables: `.env`
- Customizable parameters:
  - Data source settings
  - Analysis parameters
  - Alert thresholds
  - API credentials

### Deployment Options
1. **Docker Deployment**
   - Uses `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
   - Containerized environment for consistent deployment
   - Easy scaling and management

2. **Local Development**
   - Virtual environment setup
   - Direct installation via `requirements.txt`
   - Development tools and testing framework

## Data Flow

1. **Collection Phase**
   - Scrapers collect data from various sources
   - API integrations fetch real-time updates
   - Data standardization and initial processing

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - Document content analysis
   - Pattern matching and keyword detection
   - Threat level assessment
   - Categorization and tagging

3. **Alert Generation**
   - Threat level evaluation
   - Alert creation and categorization
   - Notification dispatch
   - Alert tracking and management
